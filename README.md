`django-twc-package` is the template for a Django package at The Westervelt Company. This template is a starting point for creating a new Django package that can be installed and used in other projects.

It is tailored to the needs of The Westervelt Company, but unlike our Django project template [`django-twc-project`](https://github.com/westerveltco/django-twc-project), it is much more generic and thus should be useful for a wider audience.

## Features

This template is built using [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io) and includes the following features:

- Modern Python project with only a [`pyproject.toml`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#pyproject-toml-spec) file
  - [`hatchling`](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) for a build backend
- [`mypy`](https://github.com/python/mypy) and [`django-stubs`](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs) for static type checking
- [`pytest`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) for testing
  - [`coverage`](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy) and [`pytest-cov`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov) for test coverage
  - [`model_bakery`](https://github.com/model-bakers/model_bakery) for easy model creation in tests
  - [`pytest-django`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-django) for Django pytest helpers
  - [`pytest-randomly`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-randomly) and [`pytest-reverse`](https://github.com/adamchainz/pytest-reverse) for keeping tests honest
  - [`pytest-xdist`](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist) for parallel testing, because ain't nobody got time for a slow test suite
- [`nox`](https://github.com/theacodes/nox) for testing across multiple versions of Python and Django, linting, and formatting
- [`bumpver`](https://github.com/mbarkhau/bumpver) for version bumping
  - Package can be configured for either [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) or [CalVer](https://calver.org) via Copier prompts

- Automatic linting and formatting via [`pre-commit`](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)
  - [`blacken-docs`](https://github.com/adamchainz/blacken-docs) because `ruff` doesn't
