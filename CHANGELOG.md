## [Unreleased]

## [2024.29]

### Removed

- Removed bootstrapping from template generation post-tasks. The tasks run in a temporary directory and so it does not create the venv or bootstrap the new project correctly.
- Removed EOL Python 3.8 as template option.

## [2024.28]

### Added

- Template is linted and bootstrapped after generation.
- Added a `gha_matrix` nox session to template for generating GHA job matrix.

### Changed

- Template now uses `uv` as a project and dependency management tool.
- GitHub Actions in template now use `astral-sh/setup-uv` for Python installation, dependency installation, and command running.
- Moved documentation and copier commands to separate Just sub-modules.
- Now using `uv` dev dependencies instead of `[dev]` extra.
- Moved template's test dependencies to dedicated `[tests]` extra.

### Removed

- Python 3.8 support for `django-twc-package` project.
- Removed `[lint]` extra from template's optional dependencies. This is now handled by `uv run`.

### Fixed

- Added correct Python version skip logic for Django 5.1 in template's `noxfile.py`.

## [2024.27]

### Added

- Django 5.1 is now available as a version choice when generating template.

### Changed

- Python 3.13 now selected by default in version list when generating template.

## [2024.26]

### Added

- Added both `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `RELEASING.md` files to official documentation.
- Added our documentation GitHub Team to `CODEOWNERS`.

### Changed

- Added `allow-prereleases: true` to all Python setup steps in GitHub Actions workflows. This should allow for easy testing of future, unreleased versions of Python.

### Fixed

- Changed documentation comment style to actual CSS comments in `docs/_static/css/custom.css`.

## [2024.25]

### Added

- Added an initial `conftest.py` configuration for Pytest test suite.
- Added an initial `test_conf.py` for testing custom app settings in package's `conf.py`.

### Fixed

- Python versions specified in all GitHub Actions workflows now surrounded by quotes, turning them from floats to strings. This avoids the potential for stripping trailing zeros, e.g. `3.10` to `3.1`.

## [2024.24]

### Fixed

- Added `workflow_call` trigger to `test.yml` GitHub Actions workflow, to allow for the `release.yml` workflow to use it before cutting a new release.

## [2024.23]

### Added

- In preparation of it's upcoming release, Python 3.13 is now available as an option when generating template.

### Removed

- Removed `labels.yml` GitHub Action. This is now handled by a GitHub bot.
- Removed use of `westerveltco/setup-ci-action` in favor of just inlining what that action does.

## [2024.22]

### Added

- Added ruff to template's `pyproject.toml` under dev extras.
- Added `conf.py` to template for configuring library.

### Changed

- Reworded two headers in the template README to better reflect their purpose.
- When cutting a release via `release.yml` GitHub Action workflow, run test suite before publishing package to PyPI. Previously the CLI tools `gh` and `jq` were used to check the most recent run of the test suite.

### Removed

- Removed unused Django 3.2 section from `should_skip` function in template's `noxfile.py`.

## [2024.21]

### Changed

- `mypy` configuration now excludes these directories: `docs`, `migrations`, `tests`, and `.venv`/`venv`.
- `djlint` configuration expanded.

## [2024.20]

### Removed

- Dropped support for Django 3.2.

## [2024.19]

### Added

- Repo and template now have a `CODEOWNERS` file for auto-assigning reviewers to PRs.

## [2024.18]

### Added

- Added the ability to pass in arguments to the `noxfile.py` test sessions.
- New `just install` command in template package's `Justfile` installs the package in editable mode with `[dev]` extras.
- Added a GitHub Action workflow for syncing labels across all projects using this template.

### Changed

- `just bootstrap` command in template package's `Justfile` now calls `@just install` instead of `uv` installation command directly.

### Removed

- `__template_version__` variable has been removed from the template package's `__init__.py` file. This is already being set in the copier answers file, so it is unneeded.

## [2024.17]

### Fixed

- Python versions in template's `test.yml` GitHub Actions workflow are now correctly using the matrix version.
- Adjusted how the `uv` package is installed in the `setup-ci-action` GitHub Actions workflow.

## [2024.16]

### Fixed

- Changed how the package within the template is referenced when bootstrapping in editable mode. Confusingly with `uv` in non-editable mode you must must specify the package name before the '@' symbol with a dot following, but in editable mode you do not need this and can reference it directly like you would expect.

## [2024.15]

### Changed

- Now using `uv` for dependency management in template.

### Fixed

- Fixed alignment of badges in docs index.

## [2024.14]

### Added

- Now using [`westerveltco/setup-ci-action`](https://github.com/westereltco/setup-ci-action) for common Python and Node.js CI/CD setup. This action sets up a Python and Node.js environment with caching and installs all dependencies for a project.
- Added example generation job to `test.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.

### Changed

- Updated the `ruff` configuration from deprecated settings to the new `ruff` configuration.

## [2024.13]

### Fixed

- Removed the unneeded `RUN_TESTS` environment variable from the GitHub Actions workflow.

## [2024.12]

### Added

- Added the `current_version` in `.copier/package.yml` answers file to `bumpver` configuration.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with the Python and Django versions in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## [2024.11]

### Changed

- All `pre-commit` hooks have been updated to use the latest versions of the tools.
  - `django-upgrade` to 1.16.0
  - `language-formatters-pre-commit-hooks` to v2.12.0
  - `prettier` to v4.0.0-alpha.8
  - `ruff-pre-commit` to 0.2.1
  - `rustywind` to 0.21.0
  - `validate-pyproject` to v0.16
- `djhtml` has been swapped out in favor of `djLint` for HTML formatting.
- `nox -l --json` is now used to generate GitHub Actions matrix for testing.

## [2024.10]

### Removed

- `create-release-pr` command from `Justfile` was removed and moved to a personal script.

### Fixed

- Path to `just` command documentation in `_cog` command.

## [2024.9]

### Added

- `just` is now installed when building documentation on Read the Docs.
- `just _cog` private command added to run the relevant docs through the `cog` tool. Useful for automatically generating documentation for cli tools such as `just`. Currently, only the `just` commands are documented, but this can be expanded in the future (e.g. `nox` or Django management commands).

### Changed

- Moved generation of the lists Python and Django versions in `noxfile.py` from Jinja2 template logic to Jinja2 extensions using `copier-template-extensions`.

## [2024.8]

### Fixed

- Added missing `SECRET_KEY` setting to `tests/settings.py` to fix the `test` and `testall` commands on certain Django versions.

## [2024.7]

## Fixed

- Added the correct Jinja escape tags so that the `test` and `testall` commands render correctly when generating a template.

## [2024.6]

### Changed

- Added additional descriptions to example headings in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `test` and `testall` Justfile commands now can take positional arguments to run specific tests.
- `lint` Justfile command now runs the relevant `nox` command instead of `pre-commit` directly.

## [2024.5]

### Changed

- Moved the common test settings from plugin to `tests/settings.py` and added a note to the installation notes in README.

### Removed

- Removed the `tests/plugins/dj_settings.py` file.

## [2024.4]

### Changed

- `generate-examples` command now removes the previous example directory before generating an example.
- Moved common test settings to separate plugin at `tests/plugins/dj_settings.py`.

### Removed

- Removed the dummy `tests/settings.py`.

## [2024.3]

### Added

- A new `generate-examples` command to the `Justfile` for generating all of the examples at once.
