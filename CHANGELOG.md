## [Unreleased]

## [2024.9]

### Added

- `just` is now installed when building documentation on Read the Docs.
- `just _cog` private command added to run the relevant docs through the `cog` tool. Useful for automatically generating documentation for cli tools such as `just`. Currently, only the `just` commands are documented, but this can be expanded in the future (e.g. `nox` or Django management commands).

### Changed

- Moved generation of the lists Python and Django versions in `noxfile.py` from Jinja2 template logic to Jinja2 extensions using `copier-template-extensions`.

## [2024.8]

### Fixed

- Added missing `SECRET_KEY` setting to `tests/settings.py` to fix the `test` and `testall` commands on certain Django versions.

## [2024.7]

## Fixed

- Added the correct Jinja escape tags so that the `test` and `testall` commands render correctly when generating a template.

## [2024.6]

### Changed

- Added additional descriptions to example headings in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `test` and `testall` Justfile commands now can take positional arguments to run specific tests.
- `lint` Justfile command now runs the relevant `nox` command instead of `pre-commit` directly.

## [2024.5]

### Changed

- Moved the common test settings from plugin to `tests/settings.py` and added a note to the installation notes in README.

### Removed

- Removed the `tests/plugins/dj_settings.py` file.

## [2024.4]

### Changed

- `generate-examples` command now removes the previous example directory before generating an example.

### Removed

## [2024.3]

### Added
